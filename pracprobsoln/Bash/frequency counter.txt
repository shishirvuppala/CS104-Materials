# Read the input file and count word frequencies

Explanation:
cat "$1": Reads the input file passed as the first argument.

tr -s '[:space:]' '\n': Transforms spaces into newlines to treat each word as a separate line.

sort: Sorts the words alphabetically so that identical words are grouped together.

uniq -c: Counts the occurrences of each word.

sort -nr: Sorts the word frequencies in descending order.

awk '{print $2 ": " $1}': Formats the output as word: frequency.
