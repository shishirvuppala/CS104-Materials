Explanation:
The script first checks if there are at least two arguments (the query element and the array).

The query element is stored in the variable query, and the rest of the arguments (the array) are stored in the array variable.

The script iterates through the array, checking if any element matches the query. If found, it sets the variable found to "YES" and breaks the loop.

If the query is not found in the array, found remains "NO".

Finally, the script outputs the value of found, which will be either "YES" or "NO".
